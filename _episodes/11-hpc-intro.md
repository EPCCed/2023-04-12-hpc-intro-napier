title: "Why Use a Cluster?"
teaching: 15
exercises: 5
questions:
- "Why would I be interested in High Performance Computing (HPC)?"
- "What can I expect to learn from this course?"
objectives:
- "Be able to describe what an HPC system is"
- "Identify how an HPC system could benefit you."  
keypoints:
- "High Performance Computing (HPC) typically involves connecting to very large computing systems
  elsewhere in the world."
- "These other systems can be used to do work that would either be impossible or much slower or
  smaller systems."
- "The standard method of interacting with such systems is via a command line interface called
  Bash."

## Why Use These Computers?

Frequently, research problems that use computing can outgrow the desktop or laptop computer where
they started:

* A statistics student wants to cross-validate their model. This involves running the model 1000
  times -- but each run takes an hour. Running on their laptop will take over a month!

* A genomics researcher has been using small datasets of sequence data, but soon will be receiving a
  new type of sequencing data that is 10 times as large. It's already challenging to open the
  datasets on their computer -- analyzing these larger datasets will probably crash it.

* An engineer is using a fluid dynamics package that has an option to run in parallel. So far, they
  haven't used this option on their desktop, but in going from 2D to 3D simulations, simulation time
  has more than tripled and it might be useful to take advantage of that feature.

In all these cases, what is needed is access to more computers than can be used at the same time.

> How could more computing help you do more or better research?
