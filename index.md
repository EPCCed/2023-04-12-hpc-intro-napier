This workshop is an introduction to using high-performance computing systems effectively.
We obviously can't cover every case or give an exhaustive course on parallel programming in just two days' of teaching time.
Instead, this workshop is intended to give students a good introduction and overview of the tools available and how to use them effectively.

By the end of this workshop, students will know how to:

* Use the UNIX command line to operate a computer, connect to a cluster, and write simple shell scripts.
* Submit and manage jobs on a cluster using a scheduler, transfer files, and use software through environment modules.

**NOTE: This is the draft HPC Carpentry release. Comments and feedback are welcome.** 
**NOTE 2: Link to https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-shell/ when that is complete. **

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Although not compulsory, command line experience will be helpful. We recommend the participants 
> to go through https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/ if new to the terminal.
