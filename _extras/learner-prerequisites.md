title: Learner Prerequisites
---

This page collects questions that learners can answer in order to judge if they
bring all prerequisites to the course.

## Required Pre-Knowledge

> **Basic Shell** â€“ Navigating directories, Copy/Moving, writing shell scripts, 
> using the environment, using wildcards

## Pre-Workshop Survey

For a motivation of this survey type, see [Greg Wilsons Template in Teaching 
Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:checklists-preassess).

### Shell

#### Moving Things

You are provided with a directory of `300` files that end with `.log`, `.data` 
and `.err` at equal proportions. You like to rename all `.log` files to `.out` 
files. How do you do this?

1. I can do that. Give me a shell and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.

#### Moving around

You are on `/bigdata/users/wolfman/projects/study` and want to jump over to 
`/bigdata/projects/experiments/at-moonlight` on the command line.

1. I can do that. Give me a shell and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.

#### Collaborator Candy

A collaborator provides you an implementation of a state-of-the-art simulation
that you need to compare your own predictions to. He tells you: "You can use it
on the command line right away. Unpack the file I sent you and use the `sim`
executable in the `bin/` folder from it. The rest is explained in the output of
the `--help` flag." You want to execute `sim` on your cluster. How do you set
up your shell for this?

1. I can do that. Give me a shell and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.

#### Automating All The Things

You observe yourself copy and pasting the same sequence of 5 commands on the
command line for more than three times during a day. You alert yourself that
you should write a script for this now. The script requires two input
arguments, i.e. two single file locations, to perform its duty.

1. I can do that. Give me a shell and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.
